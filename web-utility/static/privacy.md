Summon Privacy Policy
=====================

This privacy statement explains what data the app collects, and how that data is used.


Discovery
---------

Summon discovers URLs broadcasted from nearby peripherals using the device's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios. During this process, the peripherals' broadcast data may be sent to our servers in order to inspect URLs' content and display information about the URLs to the user. No personally identifiable information about the user or user's device is stored by our servers.


Cached Data
-----------

To improve performance, the app may cache website content, peripheral metadata, and other cookies. All of this data is stored locally on the device and may be cleared by the user in the app's settings panel at any time.


Website & Web App Access
------------------------

Like common web browsers, data made available via W3C standards for HTML, CSS, & JavaScript are accessible to opened websites. Additionally, some web apps may request access to the user device's Bluetooth radios, on-board sensors, geolocation, files, and media. Users are notified of permissions requested by a particular site in its link details before the site is opened or in permission request dialogs while the site is open.
