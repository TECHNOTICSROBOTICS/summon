Summon Web Utility
==================

A RESTful web utility to expand peripheral-advertised URLs and return metadata for the linked UI content, including title, icon URL, short summary blurb, and specific details on the use of Summon-provided hooks to native mobile features like Bluetooth.

The utility is currently run on App Engine. It is designed for and makes use of [Physical Web](https://github.com/google/physical-web)-based protocols and services.
