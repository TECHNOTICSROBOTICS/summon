User interface for [Urban Heartbeat Signpost Platform](https://github.com/lab11/signpost).

When opened on Summon, the UI parses several BLE advertisement packets from the modules of the signpost platform and displays them in corresponding visualizations.

When opened on a regular browser, the page receives data over MQTT & WebSocket from a hardware LoRa gateway placed near the signpost.
